# Automatic Trajectory Ball Spin and Velocity Tracking Applied to Bowling

Given a video of a bowling game our implementation aims at providing useful information to
the player and the viewers about each delivery. The goal is to provide as accurate as possible
information about the spin, velocity and trajectory of the ball at a processing speed that is as low as
possible. These three factors give the most important information about each delivery. We believe
that this information can help players improve their game, and give viewers more insight into what
goes into each delivery.
The information is to be retrieved using computer vision techniques on a stationary single view
video, of high resolution and frame rate. The high resolution and frame rate is a requirement to be
able to accurately analyze the video. The desired output of the system is a real time assessment
of the described performance parameters, and a trajectory of each delivery seen from above (with
correct proportions), after each delivery.
